//Q1
/*
first the js code breakdowns into token and makes abstract syntax tree.then the engine understands the AST and convert the code in machine code.then to optimize the repeated code,engine uses JIT compiler.then the engine executes the compiled code and return the result
*/

//Q2
/*
v8 engine reads the js code,understands the code and runs the code.
*/

//Q3
/*
JIT compiler converts the source code into machine code in runtime.
it converts the whole code into machine code and then search the portion of code which run frequently.then the compiler optimizes the code and run the code in runtime.
